#Nescience Neural Network Classifier [WIP]

There are two main versions of Nescience Neural Network Classifier:

+ NNNClassifier: Version using sequential (unoptimized) search

+ NNC-GE: Uses Grammatical Evolution (PonyGE2 algorithm) for developing the networks in a genetic-based way, focusing on minimizing the Nescience value on each generation.
